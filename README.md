Welcome to **Slink**, a powerful self-hosted image sharing platform designed to give users complete control over their media sharing experience. Built with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), Slink enables seamless and secure image sharing without relying on third-party services.
